# PokemonPicker
I have practically no time today so I'm only going to write up my idea for the next project.
This program will pick a Pokemon based on your criteria. The list will be loaded from a text document and will contain the following information:

-Type (Fire, Water, Grass, etc.), also allows for dual typing(Fire/Fighting, Water/Ice, Grass/Ground, etc.)

-Ability(Levitate, Shed Skin, etc.)

-Generation(1-7)

-Stat Focus(Special Attack, Attack, Defense, etc.)

I'm sure I'll think of other criteria as the program develops, but for right now that's what I'll start with.
I hope this doesn't evolve into a program of just if/else statements, so I'll look for other ways to do it.
